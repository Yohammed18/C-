# C#
C# is a versatile programming language utilized within the comprehensive .NET 6 framework for developing a wide range of applications, from web and mobile to desktop, with enhanced performance, features, and cross-platform compatibility.

## The *dotnet* command

dotnet is a command-line tool used in .NET development to perform various operations related to managing and building .NET projects. It is not specific to C# projects, but it can be used to manage projects written in C# as well as other languages supported by the .NET ecosystem, such as F# and Visual Basic.

Some common tasks you can perform with the dotnet command include:
-   Creating new projects: You can use dotnet new to create new projects from templates.
-   Building projects: dotnet build compiles the code in your project.
-   Running projects: dotnet run executes the compiled application.
-   Testing projects: dotnet test runs unit tests in your project.
-   Managing dependencies: dotnet restore restores the dependencies specified in your project file.
-   Publishing projects: dotnet publish prepares your project for deployment by packaging it and its dependencies for a specific target runtime.
